## About the Project

This dashboard, a real project developed for **Piracanjuba**, aims primarily to evaluate the **engagement and development of employees** in a technology degree course.

## Technologies and Process

*   **Tools**: Power BI Desktop (DAX, M), Figma (prototyping and design), Microsoft Excel (data sources).
*   **ETL**: Data extracted from Excel spreadsheets, transformed in Power Query and modeled for analysis.
*   **Key Insights**: Overview of students and study time, module completion (identifying bottlenecks in advanced modules), flow of new students vs. monthly completion, certificates issued by content (e.g., Power BI, Excel), and student performance ranking.
